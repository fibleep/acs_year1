# Decision Trees
## Introduction
Decision trees are a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to make predictions based on data.
- A decision tree is a model (from
Operations Research) for
representing alternatives and
choices in a decision-making
process.
## Machine Learning and Decision Trees
### Supervised (Machine) learning
- Knowledge of the result
- Learning with a human "expert"
- Data is "labeled"
#### Classification, Regression
### Unsupervised (Machine) Learning
- No knowledge of the result
- Self-guiding learning algorithm
- Data is not "labeled"
#### Clustering
## Important Phrases
### Entropy
The measure of disorder where:\
  0 -> perfect order\
  1 -> random order
### Information Gain
Reflects the gain in terms of order - the more ordered the data, the more information gain.
